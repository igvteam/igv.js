# Contributing to igv.js

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to igv.js, which is hosted in
the [igvteam repositories](https://github.com/igvteam) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best
judgment.

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the
  problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear
  description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample, executable test case, or clear set of
  instructions** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the Pull Request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if
  applicable. Keep the pull request as focused as possible. Try not to fix multiple unrelated issues with a single pull
  requess.

## **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything to the stability, functionality, or testability of igv.js
are still welcome.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change by creating a Github issue to open a discussion.

igv.js is a group effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team.

Thanks!
