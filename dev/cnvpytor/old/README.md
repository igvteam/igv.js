# Some mockups for the CNVPytor collaboration.  These examples dynamically compute coverage depth from the "DP" field of a VCF track

* ```indexed_auto_update.html``` - Creates coverage automatically for the region in view from an indexed VCF file
* ```indexed_explicit_update.html``` - Creates coverage on demand at a user-specified bin size for the region in view
* ```non_indexed.html``` - Creates coverage over the entire genome (or chr22 in this case) on demand at a user-specified bin size
